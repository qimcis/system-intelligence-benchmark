You are an expert in formal verification and TLA+ specifications with deep expertise in distributed systems and consensus protocols.

Convert the following ZooKeeper source code to a comprehensive TLA+ specification.

System: ZooKeeper Fast Leader Election protocol
Focus: {focus}

Source Code from {file_path}:
```java
{source_code}
```

ZooKeeper leader election modeling requirements:

MANDATORY CORE ACTIONS (must include):
1. 【Election Notification】Notification exchange between servers
   - Servers broadcast their votes (epoch, leader, zxid)
   - Servers receive and compare votes
   - Vote comparison based on: epoch > zxid > server_id
2. 【State Transitions】Server state changes
   - LOOKING: actively participating in election
   - FOLLOWING: accepted another server as leader
   - LEADING: won the election
3. 【Vote Tracking】Track received votes and determine quorum
   - Collect votes from other servers
   - Check if candidate has quorum (majority)
4. 【Leader Selection】Determine winner based on vote comparison
   - Higher epoch wins
   - If epoch equal, higher zxid wins
   - If zxid equal, higher server_id wins

CRITICAL SEMANTIC DISTINCTION:
- **Fast Leader Election**: ZooKeeper's leader election algorithm
  * Each server proposes itself initially
  * Servers exchange votes and update based on comparison
  * Quorum-based decision (majority required)
  * Eventual convergence to single leader

- **Vote Comparison Logic**:
  * Compare (epoch, zxid, server_id) lexicographically
  * Higher values win
  * Ensures consistent leader selection

MODELING REQUIREMENTS:
- Model each server's state (LOOKING/FOLLOWING/LEADING)
- Track current epoch and voted leader for each server
- Model notification message passing between servers
- Track vote counts for quorum calculation

EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED (do not model):
- TCP/IP network details
- Message serialization format
- QuorumCnxManager implementation
- Thread synchronization details
- Actual data replication (focus on election only)

REQUIRED BEHAVIORAL SCOPE:
- Model at least: Notification action for vote exchange
- Show election process from LOOKING to convergence
- Demonstrate quorum-based leader selection
- Include epoch advancement scenarios

Generate a complete, compilable TLA+ specification that captures the core Fast Leader Election semantics while respecting the trace validation naming conventions.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The MODULE name must be exactly "zookeeper" (---- MODULE zookeeper ----)
2. Return ONLY pure TLA+ specification code - no markdown code blocks (no ```tla or ```)
3. Do not include any explanations, comments, or formatting markers
4. Start your response directly with: ---- MODULE zookeeper ----
5. End your response with the closing ====
6. **DO NOT define invariants** (like LeaderUniqueness, etc.) - focus on modeling the system behavior
7. **MANDATORY Spec Definition**: The Spec definition should include Init and Next, with fairness assumptions
8. **Next Operator Structure**: The 'Next' operator SHOULD be a disjunction of atomic actions (e.g., Next == \/ \E t \in Threads : AcquireLock(t)...).
