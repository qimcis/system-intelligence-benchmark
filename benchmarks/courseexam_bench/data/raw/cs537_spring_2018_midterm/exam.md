## Question 1 [1 point(s)]

Problem I: A program’s main function is as follows:
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  char *str = argv[1];
  while (1)
    printf("%s", str);
  return 0;
}
Two processes, both running instances of this program, are currently running (you can assume nothing
else of relevance is, except perhaps the shell itself). The programs were invoked as follows, assuming a
“parallel command” as per project 2a (the wish shell):
wish> main a && main b
Below are possible (or impossible?) screen captures of some of the output from the beginning of the run
of the programs. Which of the following are possible? To answer: Fill in A for possible, B for not possible.
1. abababab ...
2. aaaaaaaa ...
3. bbbbbbbb ...
4. aaaabbbb ...
5. bbbbaaaa ...

## Question 3 [1 point(s)]

Problem II: Here is source code for another program, called increment.c:
int value = 0;
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  while (1) {
    printf("%d", value);
    value++;
  }
  return 0;
}
While increment.c is running, another program, reset.c, is run once as a separate process. Here is the
source code of reset.c:
int value;
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  value = 0;
  return 0;
}
Which of the following are possible outputs of the increment process? To answer: Fill in A for possible, B for not possible.

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  pthread_t p1, p2;
  pthread_create(&p1, NULL, worker, NULL);
  pthread_create(&p2, NULL, worker, NULL);
  pthread_join(p1, NULL);
  pthread_join(p2, NULL);
  printf("%d\n", counter);

## Question 5 [1 point(s)]

Problem IV: Processes exist in a number of different states. For example, xv6 has an Embryo state (used when
the process is being created), and a Zombie state (used when the process has exited but its parent hasn’t yet
called wait() on it).
Assuming you start observing the states of a given process at some point in time (not necessarily from
its creation, but perhaps including that), which process states could you possibly observe?
Note: once you start observing the process, you will see ALL states it is in, until you stop sampling.
To answer: Fill in A for possible, B for not possible.

## Question 23 [1 point(s)]

Problem XXII: Assume the following list insertion code, which inserts into a list pointed to by shared global
variable head:

  if (n == NULL) { return -1; }
  n->key = key;
  n->next = head;
  head = n;

This code is executed by each of three threads exactly once, without adding any synchronization primitives
(such as locks). Assuming malloc() is thread-safe (i.e., can be called without worries of data races)
and that malloc() returns successfully, how long might the list be when these three threads are finished
executing? (assume the list was empty to begin)

## Question 24 [1 point(s)]

Problem XXIII: Assume the following code, in which a “background malloc” allocates memory in a thread
and initializes it:
void *background_malloc(void *arg) {
  int **int_ptr = (int **) arg;
  *int_ptr = calloc(1, sizeof(int)); // allocates space for 1 int
  **int_ptr = 10;                    // calloc: also zeroes memory
  return NULL;

  pthread_t p1;
  int *result = NULL;
  pthread_create(&p1, NULL, background_malloc, &result);
  printf("%d\n", *result);
  return 0;
}
The code unfortunately is buggy. What are the possible outcomes of this code? Assume the calls to
pthread_create() and calloc() succeed, and that a NULL pointer dereference crashes reliably.
To answer: Fill in A if possible, B for not possible.
111. The code prints out 0
112. The code prints out 10
113. The code prints out 100
114. The code crashes

## Question 25 [1 point(s)]

Problem XXIV: Here is some more multi-threaded code:
void *printer(void *arg) {
  char *p = (char *) arg;
  printf("%c", *p);
  return NULL;
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  pthread_t p[5];
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    char *c = malloc(sizeof(char));
    *c = 'a' + i; // hint: 'a' + 1 = 'b', etc.
    pthread_create(&p[i], NULL, printer, (void *) c);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    pthread_join(p[i], NULL);
  return 0;
}
Assuming calls to all library routines succeed, which of the following outputs are possible?
To answer: Fill in A if possible, B for not possible.

## Question 26 [1 point(s)]

Problem XXV: Assume the same printer() function (from above), but this slightly changed main():
void *printer(void *arg) {
  char *p = (char *) arg;
  printf("%c", *p);
  return NULL;
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  pthread_t p[5];
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    char c = 'a' + i;
    pthread_create(&p[i], NULL, printer, (void *) &c);
  }
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    pthread_join(p[i], NULL);
  return 0;
}

## Question 27 [1 point(s)]

Problem XXVI: Assume the following multi-threaded memory allocator, roughly sketched out as follows:
int bytes_left = MAX_HEAP_SIZE;
pthread_cond_t c;
pthread_mutex_t m;
void *allocate(int size) {
  pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
  while (bytes_left < size)
    pthread_cond_wait(&c, &m);
  void *ptr = ...; // get mem from internal data structs
  bytes_left -= size;
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
  return ptr;
}
void free(void *ptr, int size) {
  pthread_mutex_lock(&m);
  bytes_left += size;
  pthread_cond_signal(&c);
  pthread_mutex_unlock(&m);
}
Assume all of memory is used up (i.e., bytes_left is 0). Then:
• One thread (T1) calls allocate(100)
• Some time later, a second thread (T2) calls allocate(1000)
• Finally, some time later, a third thread (T3) calls free(200)
Assuming all calls to thread library functions work as expected, which of the following are possible just
after this sequence of events has taken place? To answer: Fill in A if possible, B for not possible.
126. T1 and T2 remain blocked inside allocate()
127. T1 becomes unblocked, gets 100 bytes allocated, and returns from allocate()
128. T2 becomes unblocked, gets 1000 bytes allocated, and returns from allocate()
129. T3 becomes blocked inside free()
130. T1, T2, and T3 become deadlocked

## Question 28 [1 point(s)]

Problem XXVII: A Semaphore is a useful synchronization primitive. Which of the following statements
are true of semaphores? To answer: Fill in A if true, B for not true.
131. Each semaphore has an integer value
132. If a semaphore is initialized to 1, it can be used as a lock
133. Semaphores can be initialized to values higher than 1
134. A single lock and condition variable can be used in tandem to implement a semaphore
135. Calling sem_post() may block, depending on the current value of the semaphore

## Question 29 [1 point(s)]

Problem XXVIII: Here is the classic semaphore version of the producer/consumer problem:
void *producer(void *arg) {  // core of producer
  for (i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    sem_wait(&empty);
    sem_wait(&mutex);
    put(i);
    sem_post(&mutex);
    sem_post(&full);
  }
}
void *consumer(void *arg) {  // core of consumer
  while (!done) {
    sem_wait(&full);
    sem_wait(&mutex);
    int tmp = get(i);
    sem_post(&mutex);
    sem_post(&empty);
    // do something with tmp ...
  }
}
For the following statements about this working solution, which statements are true, and which are not?
To answer: Fill in A if true, B for not true.
136. The semaphore full must be initialized to 0
137. The semaphore full must be initialized to 1
138. The semaphore empty must be initialized to 1
139. The semaphore empty can be initialized to 1
140. The semaphore mutex must be initialized to 1

## Question 30 [1 point(s)]

Problem XXIX: One way to avoid deadlock is to schedule threads carefully. Assume the following characteristics of threads T1, T2, and T3:
• T1 (at some point) acquires and releases locks L1, L2
• T2 (at some point) acquires and releases locks L1, L3
• T3 (at some point) acquires and releases locks L3, L1, and L4
For which schedules below is deadlock possible? To answer: Fill in A if deadlock is possible, B for not possible.
141. T1 runs to completion, then T2 to completion, then T3 runs
142. T1 and T2 run concurrently to completion, then T3 runs
143. T1, T2, and T3 run concurrently
144. T3 runs to completion, then T1 and T2 run concurrently
145. T1 and T3 run concurrently to completion, then T2 runs

## Question 31 [1 point(s)]

Problem XXX: The multi-level page table. Answer these true/false questions about the multi-level page table. To answer: Fill in A if true, B for not true.
146. A multi-level page table may use more pages than a linear page table
147. It’s easier to allocate pages of the page table in a multi-level table (as compared to a linear page table)
148. Multi-level page table lookups take longer than linear page table lookups
149. With larger virtual address spaces, usually more levels are used
150. TLBs are useful in making multi-level page tables even smaller
