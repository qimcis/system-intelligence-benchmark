You'll implement a worker process that calls application Map and Reduce functions and handles reading and writing files, and a coordinator process that hands out tasks to workers and copes with failed workers. You'll be building something similar to the [MapReduce paper](http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf). (Note: this lab uses \"coordinator\" instead of the paper's \"master\".)\n## Getiting Started\nYou need to [setup Go](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.5840/2024/labs/go.html) to do the labs.\n\nFetch the initial lab software with [git](https://git-scm.com/) (a version control system). To learn more about git, look at the [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) or the [git user's manual](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html).\n\n```\n$ git clone git://g.csail.mit.edu/6.5840-golabs-2024 6.5840\n$ cd 6.5840\n$ ls\nMakefile src\n$\n```\n\nWe supply you with a simple sequential mapreduce implementation in `src/main/mrsequential.go`. It runs the maps and reduces one at a time, in a single process. We also provide you with a couple of MapReduce applications: word-count in `mrapps/wc.go`, and a text indexer in `mrapps/indexer.go`. You can run word count sequentially as follows:\n\n```\n$ cd ~/6.5840\n$ cd src/main\n$ go build -buildmode=plugin ../mrapps/wc.go\n$ rm mr-out*\n$ go run mrsequential.go wc.so pg*.txt\n$ more mr-out-0\nA 509\nABOUT 2\nACT 8\n...\n```\n\n`mrsequential.go` leaves its output in the file `mr-out-0`. The input is from the text files named `pg-xxx.txt`.\n\nFeel free to borrow code from `mrsequential.go`. You should also have a look at `mrapps/wc.go` to see what MapReduce application code looks like.\n\nFor this lab and all the others, we might issue updates to the code we provide you. To ensure that you can fetch those updates and easily merge them using `git pull`, it's best to leave the code we provide in the original files. You can add to the code we provide as directed in the lab write-ups; just don't move it. It's OK to put your own new functions in new files.\n## The Code\n\n# Your Task \nYour job is to implement a distributed MapReduce, consisting of two programs, the coordinator and the worker. There will be just one coordinator process, and one or more worker processes executing in parallel. In a real system the workers would run on a bunch of different machines, but for this lab you'll run them all on a single machine. The workers will talk to the coordinator via RPC. Each worker process will, in a loop, ask the coordinator for a task, read the task's input from one or more files, execute the task, write the task's output to one or more files, and again ask the coordinator for a new task. The coordinator should notice if a worker hasn't completed its task in a reasonable amount of time (for this lab, use ten seconds), and give the same task to a different worker.\n\nWe have given you a little code to start you off. The \"main\" routines for the coordinator and worker are in `main/mrcoordinator.go` and `main/mrworker.go`; don't change these files. You should put your implementation in `mr/coordinator.go`, `mr/worker.go`, and `mr/rpc.go`.\n\nHere's how to run your code on the word-count MapReduce application. First, make sure the word-count plugin is freshly built:\n\n```\n$ go build -buildmode=plugin ../mrapps/wc.go\n```\n\nIn the `main` directory, run the coordinator.\n\n```\n$ rm mr-out*\n$ go run mrcoordinator.go pg-*.txt\n```\n\nThe `pg-*.txt` arguments to `mrcoordinator.go` are the input files; each file corresponds to one \"split\", and is the input to one Map task.\n\nIn one or more other windows, run some workers:\n\n```\n$ go run mrworker.go wc.so\n```\n\nWhen the workers and coordinator have finished, look at the output in `mr-out-*`. When you've completed the lab, the sorted union of the output files should match the sequential output, like this:\n\n```\n$ cat mr-out-* | sort | more\nA 509\nABOUT 2\nACT 8\n...\n```\n\nWe supply you with a test script in `main/test-mr.sh`. The tests check that the `wc` and `indexer` MapReduce applications produce the correct output when given the `pg-xxx.txt` files as input. The tests also check that your implementation runs the Map and Reduce tasks in parallel, and that your implementation recovers from workers that crash while running tasks.\n\nIf you run the test script now, it will hang because the coordinator never finishes:\n\n```\n$ cd ~/6.5840/src/main\n$ bash test-mr.sh\n*** Starting wc test.\n```\n\nYou can change `ret := false` to true in the Done function in `mr/coordinator.go` so that the coordinator exits immediately. Then:\n\n```\n$ bash test-mr.sh\n*** Starting wc test.\nsort: No such file or directory\ncmp: EOF on mr-wc-all\n--- wc output is not the same as mr-correct-wc.txt\n--- wc test: FAIL\n$\n```\n\nThe test script expects to see output in files named `mr-out-X`, one for each reduce task. The empty implementations of `mr/coordinator.go` and `mr/worker.go` don't produce those files (or do much of anything else), so the test fails.\n\nWhen you've finished, the test script output should look like this:\n\n```\n$ bash test-mr.sh\n*** Starting wc test.\n--- wc test: PASS\n*** Starting indexer test.\n--- indexer test: PASS\n*** Starting map parallelism test.\n--- map parallelism test: PASS\n*** Starting reduce parallelism test.\n--- reduce parallelism test: PASS\n*** Starting job count test.\n--- job count test: PASS\n*** Starting early exit test.\n--- early exit test: PASS\n*** Starting crash test.\n--- crash test: PASS\n*** PASSED ALL TESTS\n$\n```\n\nYou may see some errors from the Go RPC package that look like\n\n```\n2019/12/16 13:27:09 rpc.Register: method \"Done\" has 1 input parameters; needs exactly three\n```\n\nIgnore these messages; registering the coordinator as an [RPC server](https://golang.org/src/net/rpc/server.go) checks if all its methods are suitable for RPCs (have 3 inputs); we know that `Done` is not called via RPC.\n\nAdditionally, depending on your strategy for terminating worker processes, you may see some errors of the form\n\n```\n2024/02/11 16:21:32 dialing:dial unix /var/tmp/5840-mr-501: connect: connection refused\n```\n\nIt is fine to see a handful of these messages per test; they arise when the worker is unable to contact the coordinator RPC server after the coordinator has exited.\n\n### A few rules:\n\n- The map phase should divide the intermediate keys into buckets for `nReduce` reduce tasks, where `nReduce` is the number of reduce tasks -- the argument that `main/mrcoordinator.go` passes to `MakeCoordinator()`. Each mapper should create `nReduce` intermediate files for consumption by the reduce tasks.\n- The worker implementation should put the output of the X'th reduce task in the file `mr-out-X`.\n- A `mr-out-X` file should contain one line per Reduce function output. The line should be generated with the Go `\"%v %v\"` format, called with the key and value. Have a look in `main/mrsequential.go` for the line commented \"this is the correct format\". The test script will fail if your implementation deviates too much from this format.\n- You can modify `mr/worker.go`, `mr/coordinator.go`, and `mr/rpc.go`. You can temporarily modify other files for testing, but make sure your code works with the original versions; we'll test with the original versions.\n- The worker should put intermediate Map output in files in the current directory, where your worker can later read them as input to Reduce tasks.\n- `main/mrcoordinator.go` expects `mr/coordinator.go` to implement a `Done()` method that returns true when the MapReduce job is completely finished; at that point, `mrcoordinator.go` will exit.\n- When the job is completely finished, the worker processes should exit. A simple way to implement this is to use the return value from `call()`: if the worker fails to contact the coordinator, it can assume that the coordinator has exited because the job is done, so the worker can terminate too. Depending on your design, you might also find it helpful to have a \"please exit\" pseudo-task that the coordinator can give to workers.\n\n### Hints\n\n- The [Guidance page](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.5840/2024/labs/guidance.html) has some tips on developing and debugging.\n\n- One way to get started is to modify `mr/worker.go`'s `Worker()` to send an RPC to the coordinator asking for a task. Then modify the coordinator to respond with the file name of an as-yet-unstarted map task. Then modify the worker to read that file and call the application Map function, as in `mrsequential.go`.\n\n- The application Map and Reduce functions are loaded at run-time using the Go plugin package, from files whose names end in `.so`.\n\n- If you change anything in the `mr/` directory, you will probably have to re-build any MapReduce plugins you use, with something like `go build -buildmode=plugin ../mrapps/wc.go`\n\n- This lab relies on the workers sharing a file system. That's straightforward when all workers run on the same machine, but would require a global filesystem like GFS if the workers ran on different machines.\n\n- A reasonable naming convention for intermediate files is `mr-X-Y`, where X is the Map task number, and Y is the reduce task number.\n\n- The worker's map task code will need a way to store intermediate key/value pairs in files in a way that can be correctly read back during reduce tasks. One possibility is to use Go's encoding/json package. To write key/value pairs in JSON format to an open file:\n\n  ```\n    enc := json.NewEncoder(file)\n    for _, kv := ... {\n      err := enc.Encode(&kv)\n  ```\n\n  and to read such a file back:\n\n  ```\n    dec := json.NewDecoder(file)\n    for {\n      var kv KeyValue\n      if err := dec.Decode(&kv); err != nil {\n        break\n      }\n      kva = append(kva, kv)\n    }\n  ```\n\n- The map part of your worker can use the `ihash(key)` function (in `worker.go`) to pick the reduce task for a given key.\n\n- You can steal some code from `mrsequential.go` for reading Map input files, for sorting intermediate key/value pairs between the Map and Reduce, and for storing Reduce output in files.\n\n- The coordinator, as an RPC server, will be concurrent; don't forget to lock shared data.\n\n- Use Go's race detector, with `go run -race`. `test-mr.sh` has a comment at the start that tells you how to run it with `-race`. When we grade your labs, we will **not** use the race detector. Nevertheless, if your code has races, there's a good chance it will fail when we test it even without the race detector.\n\n- Workers will sometimes need to wait, e.g. reduces can't start until the last map has finished. One possibility is for workers to periodically ask the coordinator for work, sleeping with `time.Sleep()` between each request. Another possibility is for the relevant RPC handler in the coordinator to have a loop that waits, either with `time.Sleep()` or `sync.Cond`. Go runs the handler for each RPC in its own thread, so the fact that one handler is waiting needn't prevent the coordinator from processing other RPCs.\n\n- The coordinator can't reliably distinguish between crashed workers, workers that are alive but have stalled for some reason, and workers that are executing but too slowly to be useful. The best you can do is have the coordinator wait for some amount of time, and then give up and re-issue the task to a different worker. For this lab, have the coordinator wait for ten seconds; after that the coordinator should assume the worker has died (of course, it might not have).\n\n- If you choose to implement Backup Tasks (Section 3.6), note that we test that your code doesn't schedule extraneous tasks when workers execute tasks without crashing. Backup tasks should only be scheduled after some relatively long period of time (e.g., 10s).\n\n- To test crash recovery, you can use the `mrapps/crash.go` application plugin. It randomly exits in the Map and Reduce functions.\n\n- To ensure that nobody observes partially written files in the presence of crashes, the MapReduce paper mentions the trick of using a temporary file and atomically renaming it once it is completely written. You can use `ioutil.TempFile` (or `os.CreateTemp` if you are running Go 1.17 or later) to create a temporary file and `os.Rename` to atomically rename it.\n\n- `test-mr.sh` runs all its processes in the sub-directory `mr-tmp`, so if something goes wrong and you want to look at intermediate or output files, look there. Feel free to temporarily modify `test-mr.sh` to `exit` after the failing test, so the script does not continue testing (and overwrite the output files).\n\n- `test-mr-many.sh` runs `test-mr.sh` many times in a row, which you may want to do in order to spot low-probability bugs. It takes as an argument the number of times to run the tests. You should not run several `test-mr.sh` instances in parallel because the coordinator will reuse the same socket, causing conflicts.\n\n- Go RPC sends only struct fields whose names start with capital letters. Sub-structures must also have capitalized field names.\n\n- When calling the RPC call() function, the reply struct should contain all default values. RPC calls should look like this:\n\n  ```\n    reply := SomeType{}\n    call(..., &reply)\n  ```\n\n  without setting any fields of reply before the call. If you pass reply structures that have non-default fields, the RPC system may silently return incorrect values.\n", "test_method": "cd src/main && bash test-mr.sh", "test_results": "*** Starting wc test.\n--- wc test: PASS\n*** Starting indexer test.\n--- indexer test: PASS\n*** Starting map parallelism test.\n--- map parallelism test: PASS\n*** Starting reduce parallelism test.\n--- reduce parallelism test: PASS\n*** Starting job count test.\n--- job count test: PASS\n*** Starting early exit test.\n--- early exit test: PASS\n*** Starting crash test.\n--- crash test: PASS\n*** PASSED ALL TESTS", "difficulty": "moderate/hard", "link": "http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.5840/2024/labs/lab-mr.html", "docker_env": "xuafeng/swe-go-python:latest", "repo_url": "git://g.csail.mit.edu/6.5840-golabs-2024", "repo_path": "projects/6.5840-golabs-2024"}
{"task_id": "system_lab_2", "task_name": "problems/system_lab_2.md", "task": "# Problem Context\n## Introduction\nIn this lab you will build a key/value server for a single machine that ensures that each operation is executed exactly once despite network failures and that the operations are [linearizable](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.5840/2024/papers/linearizability-faq.txt). Later labs will replicate a server like this one to handle server crashes.\n\nClients can send three different RPCs to the key/value server: `Put(key, value)`, `Append(key, arg)`, and `Get(key)`. The server maintains an in-memory map of key/value pairs. Keys and values are strings. `Put(key, value)` installs or replaces the value for a particular key in the map, `Append(key, arg)` appends arg to key's value *and* returns the old value, and `Get(key)` fetches the current value for the key. A `Get` for a non-existent key should return an empty string. An `Append` to a non-existent key should act as if the existing value were a zero-length string. Each client talks to the server through a `Clerk` with Put/Append/Get methods. A `Clerk` manages RPC interactions with the server.\n\nYour server must arrange that application calls to `Clerk` Get/Put/Append methods be linearizable. If client requests aren't concurrent, each client Get/Put/Append call should observe the modifications to the state implied by the preceding sequence of calls. For concurrent calls, the return values and final state must be the same as if the operations had executed one at a time in some order. Calls are concurrent if they overlap in time: for example, if client X calls `Clerk.Put()`, and client Y calls `Clerk.Append()`, and then client X's call returns. A call must observe the effects of all calls that have completed before the call starts.\n\nLinearizability is convenient for applications because it's the behavior you'd see from a single server that processes requests one at a time. For example, if one client gets a successful response from the server for an update request, subsequently launched reads from other clients are guaranteed to see the effects of that update. Providing linearizability is relatively easy for a single server.\n## Getiting Started\nWe supply you with skeleton code and tests in `src/kvsrv`. You will need to modify `kvsrv/client.go`, `kvsrv/server.go`, and `kvsrv/common.go`.\n\nTo get up and running, execute the following commands.
