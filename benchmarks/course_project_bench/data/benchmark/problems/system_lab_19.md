# Problem Context

## Introduction

This is the first in a series of labs in which you'll build a fault-tolerant key/value storage system. In this lab you'll implement Raft, a replicated state machine protocol. In the next lab you'll build a key/value service on top of Raft. Then you will ÂshardÂ your service over multiple replicated state machines for higher performance.

A replicated service achieves fault tolerance by storing complete copies of its state (i.e., data) on multiple replica servers. Replication allows the service to continue operating even if some of its servers experience failures (crashes or a broken or flaky network). The challenge is that failures may cause the replicas to hold differing copies of the data.

Raft organizes client requests into a sequence, called the log, and ensures that all the replica servers see the same log. Each replica executes client requests in log order, applying them to its local copy of the service's state. Since all the live replicas see the same log contents, they all execute the same requests in the same order, and thus continue to have identical service state. If a server fails but later recovers, Raft takes care of bringing its log up to date. Raft will continue to operate as long as at least a majority of the servers are alive and can talk to each other. If there is no such majority, Raft will make no progress, but will pick up where it left off as soon as a majority can communicate again.

In this lab you'll implement Raft as a Go object type with associated methods, meant to be used as a module in a larger service. A set of Raft instances talk to each other with RPC to maintain replicated logs. Your Raft interface will support an indefinite sequence of numbered commands, also called log entries. The entries are numbered with *index numbers*. The log entry with a given index will eventually be committed. At that point, your Raft should send the log entry to the larger service for it to execute.

You should follow the design in the [extended Raft paper](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.5840/2025/papers/raft-extended.pdf), with particular attention to Figure 2. You'll implement most of what's in the paper, including saving persistent state and reading it after a node fails and then restarts. You will not implement cluster membership changes (Section 6).

This lab is due in four parts. You must submit each part on the corresponding due date.

## Getiting Started

Do a `git pull` to get the latest lab software.

If you have done Lab 1, you already have a copy of the lab source code. If not, you can find directions for obtaining the source via git in the [Lab 1 instructions](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.5840/2025/labs/lab-mr.html).

We supply you with skeleton code `src/raft/raft.go`. We also supply a set of tests, which you should use to drive your implementation efforts, and which we'll use to grade your submitted lab. The tests are in `src/raft/raft_test.go`.

When we grade your submissions, we will run the tests without the [`-race` flag](https://go.dev/blog/race-detector). However, you should check that your code does not have races, by running the tests with the `-race` flag as you develop your solution.

To get up and running, execute the following commands. Don't forget the `git pull` to get the latest software.

```
$ cd ~/6.5840
$ git pull
...
$ cd src/raft1
$ go test
Test (3A): initial election (reliable network)...
Fatal: expected one leader, got none
--- FAIL: TestInitialElection3A (4.90s)
Test (3A): election after network failure (reliable network)...
Fatal: expected one leader, got none
--- FAIL: TestReElection3A (5.05s)
...
$
```

## The Code

Implement Raft by adding code to `raft/raft.go`. In that file you'll find skeleton code, plus examples of how to send and receive RPCs.

Your implementation must support the following interface, which the tester and (eventually) your key/value server will use. You'll find more details in comments in `raft.go`.

```
// create a new Raft server instance:
rf := Make(peers, me, persister, applyCh)

// start agreement on a new log entry:
rf.Start(command interface{}) (index, term, isleader)

// ask a Raft for its current term, and whether it thinks it is leader
rf.GetState() (term, isLeader)

// each time a new entry is committed to the log, each Raft peer
// should send an ApplyMsg to the service (or tester).
type ApplyMsg
```

A service calls `Make(peers,me,Â)` to create a Raft peer. The peers argument is an array of network identifiers of the Raft peers (including this one), for use with RPC. The `me` argument is the index of this peer in the peers array. `Start(command)` asks Raft to start the processing to append the command to the replicated log. `Start()` should return immediately, without waiting for the log appends to complete. The service expects your implementation to send an `ApplyMsg` for each newly committed log entry to the `applyCh` channel argument to `Make()`.

`raft.go` contains example code that sends an RPC (`sendRequestVote()`) and that handles an incoming RPC (`RequestVote()`). Your Raft peers should exchange RPCs using the labrpc Go package (source in `src/labrpc`). The tester can tell `labrpc` to delay RPCs, re-order them, and discard them to simulate various network failures. While you can temporarily modify `labrpc`, make sure your Raft works with the original `labrpc`, since that's what we'll use to test and grade your lab. Your Raft instances must interact only with RPC; for example, they are not allowed to communicate using shared Go variables or files.

Subsequent labs build on this lab, so it is important to give yourself enough time to write solid code.

# Your Task

If a Raft-based server reboots it should resume service where it left off. This requires that Raft keep persistent state that survives a reboot. The paper's Figure 2 mentions which state should be persistent.

A real implementation would write Raft's persistent state to disk each time it changed, and would read the state from disk when restarting after a reboot. Your implementation won't use the disk; instead, it will save and restore persistent state from a `Persister` object (see `persister.go`). Whoever calls `Raft.Make()` supplies a `Persister` that initially holds Raft's most recently persisted state (if any). Raft should initialize its state from that `Persister`, and should use it to save its persistent state each time the state changes. Use the `Persister`'s `ReadRaftState()` and `Save()` methods.

Complete the functions `persist()` and `readPersist()` in `raft.go` by adding code to save and restore persistent state. You will need to encode (or "serialize") the state as an array of bytes in order to pass it to the `Persister`. Use the `labgob` encoder; see the comments in `persist()` and `readPersist()`. `labgob` is like Go's `gob` encoder but prints error messages if you try to encode structures with lower-case field names. For now, pass `nil` as the second argument to `persister.Save()`. Insert calls to `persist()` at the points where your implementation changes persistent state. Once you've done this, and if the rest of your implementation is correct, you should pass all of the 3C tests.

You will probably need the optimization that backs up nextIndex by more than one entry at a time. Look at the [extended Raft paper](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.5840/2025/papers/raft-extended.pdf) starting at the bottom of page 7 and top of page 8 (marked by a gray line). The paper is vague about the details; you will need to fill in the gaps. One possibility is to have a rejection message include:

```
    XTerm:  term in the conflicting entry (if any)
    XIndex: index of first entry with that term (if any)
    XLen:   log length
```

Then the leader's logic can be something like:

```
  Case 1: leader doesn't have XTerm:
    nextIndex = XIndex
  Case 2: leader has XTerm:
    nextIndex = (index of leader's last entry for XTerm) + 1
  Case 3: follower's log is too short:
    nextIndex = XLen
```

A few other hints:

- Run `git pull` to get the latest lab software.
- The 3C tests are more demanding than those for 3A or 3B, and failures may be caused by problems in your code for 3A or 3B.

Your code should pass all the 3C tests (as shown below), as well as the 3A and 3B tests.

```
$ go test -run 3C

  ... Passed --  16.1  5  7204    0
PASS
ok      6.5840/raft1    126.054s
$
```

It is a good idea to run the tests multiple times before submitting and check that each run prints `PASS`.

```
for i in {0..10}; do go test; done
```
